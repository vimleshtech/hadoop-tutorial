Edit the “.bashrc” file to update the environment variables of Apache Pig. We are setting it so that we can access pig from any directory, we need not go to pig directory to execute pig commands. Also, if any other application is looking for Pig, it will get to know the path of Apache Pig from this file.

$sudo gedit .bashrc

Add the following at the end of the file:

# Set PIG_HOME

export PIG_HOME=/home/tv/pig-0.16.0
export PATH=$PATH:/home/tv/pig-0.16.0/bin
export PIG_CLASSPATH=$HADOOP_CONF_DIR


$source .bashrc
$pig -version
$pig -help

--Run Pig to start the grunt shell. Grunt shell is used to run Pig Latin scripts
$pig


Execution modes in Apache Pig:
MapReduce Mode – This is the default mode, which requires access to a Hadoop cluster and HDFS installation. Since, this is a default mode, it is not necessary to specify -x flag ( you can execute pig OR pig -x mapreduce). The input and output in this mode are present on HDFS.
Local Mode – With access to a single machine, all files are installed and run using a local host and file system. Here the local mode is specified using ‘-x flag’ (pig -x local). The input and output in this mode are present on local file system.

$pig -x local
